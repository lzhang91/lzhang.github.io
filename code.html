  <h3><a href="https://github.com/anthonyamendolare00/KeyLoggerScreenshotMouseClickTracker/blob/main/KeyLoggerScreenshotMouseClickTracker.py">Keylogger Project</a></h3>
  <section>A keylogger will monitor keystrokes made by the user on a keyboard. This keylogger implements a timestamp that shows the exact date and time the key was pressed/released on the keyboard. Also, a mouse click tracker that displays the click location of the mouse, as well as a screenshot of your screen. First, the keylogger runs but once the user presses the Esc key the system takes a screenshot and switches to the mouse click tracker.</section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/anthonyamendolare00/stock_project/blob/main/stock_project.py">Stock Analysis Project</a></h3>
  <section>Using Google Colab and a Tesla csv file, this program creates interactive candlesticks with Python using the plotly library that is mainly used for plotting data. I then added a 3 moving average strategy, Bollinger Bands strategy, and On Balance Volume strategy using a TSLA.csv file. The goal of this project was to use the matplotlib library for data visualization. As well as using a different type of python IDE (Google Colab) and working with stock data.</section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/anthonyamendolare00/MontyHallProblem/blob/main/main.py">Monty Hall Problem Project</a></h3>
  <section>The Monty Hall problem is a puzzle of probability. A gameshow with 3 doors, a prize (car) and 2 goats. This program shows that switching doors is the better option. For instance, the winning outcome when switching doors is 2/3, while not switching doors decreases your win percentage to 1/3. In addition, I visualized the Monty Hall problem by showing that increasing the sample size, increases your win percentage. My goal of this project was to work with probability in python and understand a brain teaser in the math world.</section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/anthonyamendolare00/EmailwPython/blob/main/emailAnthonyAmendolare.py">Email Project</a></h3>
  <section>Python's smtp library helps send emails through easy automation. The email can attach a subject, to, from, image, links, and texts. It is ideal to use a Gmail account and the sender's email must have a password that is known to allow access to send the email. Port 587 is a default mail submission port. The goal of this project was to find new libraries that I have not used before when coding in Python including ssl and smtplib.</section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/anthonyamendolare00/SimpML-LR">Simple Machine Learning Project</a></h3>
  <section>This program is a basic, simple machine learning project. This program attempts to predict the coefficients in a linear function. The goal of this project was to gain more knowledge on machine learning in python. As well as using the sklearn library and linear regression, which are both powerful tools for machine learning.</section>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/anthonyamendolare00/CryptocurrencyPriceAlert/blob/main/main.py">Cryptocurrency Price Alert Project</a></h3>
  <section>This program extracts the price of a cryptocurrency coin through BeautifulSoup. The price is then sent to an email using the smtp, ssl, and mime library. Two functions are created to send the email and send an alert about every 30 seconds. Inside the email is HTML text that shows the price of the cryptocurrency coin. My goal of this program was to use my previous email project and add a new objective to the program.</section>
