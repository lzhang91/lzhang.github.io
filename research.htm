		    <br><em> Journal of Public Economic Theory </em>, Vol. 24(4) 733-55, 2022.
		    <div class="abstract">
       We experimentally study the impact of inequality on the effectiveness of contests for funding public goods in a development context. We observe that the typical result of a lottery funding mechanism leading to greater funding for the public good than predicted by theory extends to groups with inequality. However, while theory suggests that increased inequality should lower total contributions to a lottery funded public good, we observe the opposite pattern. This result differs from prior results for the standard voluntary contribution mechanism where increased inequality has been found to reduce public good provision. Moreover, we find that the poor do not contribute a greater share of their endowment to the public good than do the wealthy. Thus, overall our study demonstrates the potential for community development projects, when funded with a lottery mechanism, to be highly successful even in the presence of inequality and may facilitate a progressive redistribution of wealth.

Market</div> <a href="Job Market Paper.pdf" download>[PDF]</a></p> 
	
		<div class="abstract">
        People often pay a premium for products linked to charity due to the belief that part or all the revenue generated from such purchases is a public good. However, accurately quantifying the value of public goods is challenging due to identification issues. This study aims to address this challenge by leveraging two sets of bidding data from eBay on charity and non-charity auctions of identical products. I employ an nonparametric approach to identify bidders' public goods values within an independent private values paradigm, providing a unique and valuable insight into the motivations behind charitable giving through auction data. Specifically, by using the variation in donation percentages in the charity auction set, this study develops structural altruistic estimators to uncover each bidder's latent private value, which is a combination of the value of the auction item and the linked public good. In the non-charity auction set, the latent private value of each bidder is identified based on the auction item alone. Then the difference between the latent private values of the two sets is used to determine the value placed on charity-linked products, assuming that the two sets have the same underlying distribution of private values on the auction item. The results show that on average, bidders bid 6\% more in charity auctions compared to non-charity auctions, driven primarily by the warm glow of giving, the joy from the act of giving.

		<div class="abstract">
       Given the threshold role of the unit elasticity in determining whether the current tax policy is effective in terms of encouraging charitable giving,  a clear conclusion on the relationship between the estimated price elasticity and unit elasticity is required. However, studies on this topic report mixed results in terms of the magnitude of price elasticity. To investigate the heterogeneity between studies on estimating the price elasticity of charitable giving, we identify and synthesize 81 studies with 113 point estimates. By doing so, we updated the robust estimation of the elasticity. We also contribute a better understanding of the current mixed results on this topic by exploring the potential moderators. These moderators in turn shed light on the future research direction.

Experiments</div>with John A. List, Daniel J. Lee, and Michael K. Price</p>
			<div class="abstract">
       This study investigates the individual-level price elasticity of charitable giving by employing a field experiment coupled with a structural estimation. Our findings reveal an average price elasticity of -1.22, suggesting that a 10% increase in the price of giving leads to a 12.2% decrease in charitable contributions. Notably, the analysis highlights considerable heterogeneity in price elasticity across various demographic and behavioral factors, such as age, education, income, rationality, and political affiliation. A more pronounced distribution of price elasticity is observed within subgroups as opposed to across subgroups, indicating greater heterogeneity within categories than between them. Simulation results demonstrate that disregarding within-group heterogeneity in price elasticity can result in inaccurate policy implications, especially regarding the influence of tax policies on charitable giving. Overall, the study emphasizes the significance of accounting for differences in price elasticity both across and within subgroups, with particular attention to within-subgroup variations, for a precise estimation of policy intervention effects on charitable giving.
