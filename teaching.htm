	    <li>"Professor Zhang effectively fostered learning by explaining complex concepts in simple terms and engaging students in discussions. She provided clear examples and encouraged questions, making the material easier to understand."</li>
	      <li>"I enjoyed this class a lot, and believe anybody would. It focuses on learning more than a grade in my opinion, which all classes should strive to do. However, it is not difficult to pass this class if you put the effort in. I think anyone should take this class. You can learn a lot from it." </li>
     <li>"Dr. Li breaks the topics into very digestible and consumable pieces of information."</li>
	    <li>"I really like how the instructor utilized lectures, but also made sure to stop whenever we seemed confused or had questions. Overall, very effective."</li>
	    <li>"The teacher undertsands the students and their needs while still making the course challenging."</li>
	    <li>"The instructor was great. Her lecture style was perfect! I never left the class without understanding a topic. It was great to always understand the lecture and I have to thank Li for that!"</li>
	     <li>"Professor Li always taught the material from the textbook, reinforcing the readings and making the topics more familiar. For the majority of the course, she seemed knowledgeable on the subject, with the ability to explain it in a way that students new to the field could understand. it was an excellent course to take."</li>
	    
	  <p align="left"><h4>Inclusiveness</h4></p>

	    <li>"She was very helpful and wanted everyone to do as good as possible. She really cares about each individual student doing well."</li>
	    <li>"The instructor was very effective in fostering learning, as she used a variety of tactics to explain the material, and was always available during office hours."</li>
	    <li>"Professor Zhang was extremely effective in fostering learning. She encouraged participation in class and was very effective at teaching the material. She was also great with office hours and was always willing to squeeze in a student to help them understand certain material."</li>

	    <li>"The various components of the course helped me learn a lot. Professor Zhang's lectures and examples in class gave me a basic understanding of the material, and the homework and tests were a great way to test my understanding, and apply what I learned to actual questions."</li>
	    <li>"I think everything that we learned about was useful for my knowledge, and all of the components of the course flowed together and all made sense. Every unit we learned all went back to the first few, and all tied together smoothly."</li>

	  <p align="left"><h4>Accessibility</h4></p>
   
	    <li>"I made the recommendation I did because professor Zhang is very helpful. She wants her students to do well. If students go to her office hours, you really get to see how much she really cares. She will help you if you're struggling, she will help you if you need help studying. She is very kind and explains everything very well. Everything is easy to follow when she teaches which means she does a great job explaining everything. Would 100\% recommend this course." </li> 
	   <li> "I think she was a great instructor, in fact I chose to be in her class again next semester. She is very dedicated to her work and never missed or canceled a class. She always made sure we clearly understood the material and was always there and willing to help at office hours."</li>  
 <li>"Dr. Li was very encouraging and always positive with us throughout the semester. She explained things clearly and simply and always checked for understanding, and was always open to provide extra help during office hours or after class."</li>

	    <li>"The instructor made herself available for office hours and encouraged students to stop by if they had any questions or concerns. She also encouraged every student to participate in presenting a part of the textbook to the class and acting as a teacher to give students experience with collaborating in a group as well as with public speaking."</li>
	    <li>"Professor Li is a very good professor. I know I can go to her office during office hours and get a ton of help with questions and problems I do not understand. I have taken her class two times now and hope to take another class in the future."</li>
